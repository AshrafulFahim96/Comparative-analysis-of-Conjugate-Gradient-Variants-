# Comparative-analysis-of-Conjugate-Gradient-Variants-
Comparative analysis on the CG Variants namely: FR, PRP, HS, DY


This paper tackles the various concepts of denoising, specifically ones that lead to 1D signals. The data worked on corresponds to the outbreak of the covid19 pandemic and the various data points throughout the pandemic, over a period, specifically for Malaysia. Aside from this, a test dataset is used to deduce reasonable comparative data to determine the best fit model of variants for conjugate gradients. The conjugate gradient method, which has seen a reasonably positive response for 2D signal denoising over images, is applied in an attempt to comparatively analyze the best fit variant for the dataset. This is coupled with wavelet minimization, over an alternating minimization algorithm, to find the best fit solution.
